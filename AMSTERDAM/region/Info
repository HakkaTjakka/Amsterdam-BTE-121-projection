done0 is contents for %appdata%\.minecraft\.minecraft\saves\WORLDNAME\region floor 0 (y=0 to 255)
done-1 is contents for floor -1 (-1 to -256) if converting to cubic chunks format. (Only 20 region files containts some data under 0)
This case nothing tops 255, so only 2 floors. (Compared to New York, 5 floors, -2 to 2)
